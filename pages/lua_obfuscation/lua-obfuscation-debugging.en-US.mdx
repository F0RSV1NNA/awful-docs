# Debugging obfuscated code

Not only will attackers have a hard time but also you will as the in-game Lua errors will give obfuscated outputs. This means that _(local)_ variable names and line numbers are no longer trustworthy.

## How to troubleshoot my users?

The solution is to fire up VSCode, download the [lua-obfuscator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ferib.lua-obfuscator) plugin and obfuscate your own code with the correct settings used by us.

This way, you transform the original input code into the exact same obfuscated code.

> Make sure your local version matches the same as the public one.
>
> Be aware that updates might happen to the obfuscator which can give different results. You might have to publish again for your live code to be obfuscated with the latest version.
