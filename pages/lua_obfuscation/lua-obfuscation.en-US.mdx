# What is it?

"In software development, obfuscation is the act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans or computers to understand." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software))

In other words, obfuscating your Lua will make it much harder for anyone to understand what it is doing while the computer process _(in our case, Wow)_ is still able to execute

# But, why?

Your code runs on the client-side and is susceptible to attacks such as memory dumping and reverse engineering.

Wow prohibits closed-source AddOns, and thus pre-compiled Lua scripts are not permitted. Only Lua scripts in text format are allowed to be loaded. As a result, it is simple for Lua scripts to be intercepted or extracted.

To increase the security of your scripts against these vulnerabilities, we offer an optional built-in obfuscator.

# How to use

It is easy, flip the box!
