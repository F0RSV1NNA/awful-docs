### **awful.path**

- Returns an [awful path](navigation#path)

> Create path from player to target

```lua
local player, target = awful.player, awful.target

-- path from player to target
local path = awful.path(player, target)

-- simplify path
path = path.simplify()

-- iterate path
path.loop(function(p)
  local x,y,z = p.x, p.y, p.z

  -- do stuff with point in path

  -- break loop by returning true
  return true
end)
```

> Path between player and coords, plus some other methods of path

```lua
awful.onTick(function()
  local path = awful.path(player, x, y, z)
  -- simplify path, both args (tolerance, highestQuality) optional
  path = path.simplify(1, 1)
  -- draw line between each point in the path
  path.draw()
  -- follow the path (moves your character along the path)
  path.follow()
end)
```

### path object

- path object is first return of `awful.path`
- an array of nodes `{ x = 1093.3312, y = 1996.940, z = 92.01355 }`
- contains some built in methods for manipulating and interacting with the path
- unlocker agnostic, should work nearly the same with any unlocker supported

```lua
-- returns the path simplified with Douglas Peucker path simplification algorithm
path.simplify(tolerance, highestQuality)

-- draws the path for this tick
path.draw()

-- follow the path, moving your character along it each time called
path.follow()
```
