# What are they?
> They function the same as [awful object attributes](object-attributes), so it's worth reading up on those if you haven't.
>
> Item Objects have many attributes of their own though, usually relating to some **information about the item**, most of which is derived from the **Item ID** using WoW API, which is why you must provide it instead of a item name. Here are some examples of item attributes:
>
> **item.cd** - Current cooldown of the item
>
> **item.name** - Name of the item
>
> **item.range** - Max range of the item
>
> Simple and effective :)

# Item Attributes

## castTime

> The cast time of the item (0 for instant cast items)

```lua
if target.magicImmunityRemains < item.castTime then
  item:Cast(target)
end
```

## cd

> Current cooldown of the item

- `cooldown` is another valid key for the same attribute

```lua
if item.cd > 10 then
  print("dang it, gonna be a while before i can use this one")
end
```

## id

> The ItemID of the item. You provided it we're just giving it back.

## equipped

> Whether or not we have the item equipped, which can be surprisingly annoying to find out.

```lua
if not item.equipped then
  print("check your bags, did you forget to equip your weapon again homie?")
end
```

## numequipped

> How many of the provided items you have equipped, such as tier pieces.

```lua
local tierPieces = NewItem({1234, 5678, 9012, 3456})
if item.numequipped < 2 then
  print("you don't even have 2-set, what are you doing?")
end
```

## count

> How many of the item we have, such as amount of Health Potions

```lua
if item.count < 10 then
  print("better hit the auction house, you're running low on pots!")
end
```

## name

> The proper name of the item

```lua
awful.alert(item.name)
```

## range

> The max range the item can be cast at

```lua
if target.dist < item.range then
  awful.alert('hallelujah')
end
```

## usable

> Whether or not the item is currently "usable"

```lua
if item.usable then
  item:Use()
end
```
