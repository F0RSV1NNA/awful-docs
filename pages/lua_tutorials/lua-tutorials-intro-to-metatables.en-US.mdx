# Intro to Metatables

> **Time Estimate:** 5-10 mins.

## What is a "metatable"?

At the most basic of levels: a table!

The "metatable" of a table is a pointer<sup>1</sup> which tells the Lua interpreter where to find answers when a metamethod (we'll get to these later, stay with me here!) is invoked.

*<sup>1</sup> - A pointer is a reference to something else, typically in programming a pointer references the memory address for something like a variable.*

## How do metatables magically appear?

Metatables are set and retrieved via two functions: `setmetatable` and `getmetatable`.

Let's do a quick real-world test:
```lua
-- declare a generic table
local x = { }
-- set a value
x.a = 1
-- assign a metatable for table x, pointing to table x
setmetatable( x, x )
-- query and dump the metatable
DevTools_Dump( getmetatable( x ) )
```

You'll find the result of the `DevTools_Dump` command looks like this:
```lua
a = 1
```

Because remember, the metatable is only a pointer telling the interpreter **where metamethods live**!

### So what happened here?

We created table `x`. We told the interpreter the location of the metatable for table `x` is **ALSO** table `x`!

### Hang on, my brain hurts.. Why would we tell the interpreter the metatable for a table is.. the table?

That brings us to the second part I referenced above, and soon all shall be revealed. Feel free to take a break, apply some ice to your forehead and continue on when you're ready!

## What is a "metamethod"?

Metamethods are the second half of the puzzle that allow metatables to make sense! Similarly to the metatable, at their most basic levels metamethods are just that: methods<sup>1</sup>!

*<sup>1</sup> - Methods are very similar to functions, the key difference being methods receive their parent object as the first arg!*

We mentioned in the previous section setting a metatable tells the Lua interpreter where to find answers when a metamethod is invoked. But, what does this mean?

There are a number of "metamethods" known to the Lua interpreter. Some of the more popular of these metamethods include: `__index`, `__call` and `__newindex`.

### Let's start with __call!

Have you ever made a table where it could be useful to be able to use it like a function? This is exactly what `__call` provides!

So how do we implement `__call`? It's as simple as creating any other function within a table. Let's work through a quick example:
```lua
-- declare a generic table
local x = { }
-- assign an arbitrary value
x.a = 2
-- let's assign __call to multiply a by a value we provide
x.__call = function( self, multiple )
    -- set a default value for multiple
    multiple = multiple or 1
    -- multiply by our arg and print!
    print( self.a * multiple )
end
-- invoke it!
x()
```

Hmm.. I've done the things, and invoked my `x` table like `x()` but nothing happened... what gives? Remember your training young padawan! In the previous section we mentioned the purpose of `setmetatable`, which is to tell the interpreter where to find answers when a metamethod is invoked! So let's take another crack at it...
```lua
-- declare a generic table
local x = { }
-- assign an arbitrary value
x.a = 2
-- let's assign __call to multiply a by a value we provide
x.__call = function( self, multiple )
    -- set a default value for multiple
    multiple = multiple or 1
    -- multiply by our arg and print!
    print( self.a * multiple )
end
-- set the metatable!
setmetatable( x, x )
-- invoke it!
x()
x( 2 )
```

Oh boy it did stuff! We now see output like this:
```lua
2
4
```

### OK, help me understand what just happened...

Well let's recap!

**Remember: the Lua interpreter is built to go looking for answers in the metatable when certain things are done with tables.**

Following our above `__call` exercise, if you take a table and slap some parenthesis on the end of it `()` - this tells the interpreter to go looking **in the metatable for a `__call` method**!

**So taking it from the top:**
* We created table `x`
* We told the interpreter, "Hey, there's a metatable for `x` here!", by using `setmetatable( x, x )`
* We created metamethod `__call` by simply doing `x.__call = function( self, multiple ) -- doStuffHere end`
* We invoked `x` like a method `x()`, indicating to the Lua interpreter to check the metatable (`getmetatable(x)`) for a `__call` method
* Since we set our metatable - `x.__call()` is invoked and voila!

Now go let your head cool off, pat yourself on the back and stay tuned for more on the other metamethods shortly!
